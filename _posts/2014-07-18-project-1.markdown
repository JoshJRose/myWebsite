<h3> The Quest to Unleash Potential </h3>
<p>Innovate Trent is a school organization aimed to facilitate creative ideas and turn them into real projects.  Here students of Trent University are encouraged to build connections and use our resources to engage in varoius project development initiatives ranging from research proposals to full startup businesses.  This organization was founded by some talanted and ambitious computer science students (including myself) in the winter of 2018, with the intention of taking advantage of the schools recent popularity and rapid expansion. </p>
