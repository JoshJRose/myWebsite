    <h3>Solid Note Taking </h3>
<p>I fully believe my most creative and genuine sketches come from me being unnable to focus on lectures.  Here are some peices recovered from school notebooks.</p>
    <div id="demo" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">

  <!-- Indicators -->
  <ul class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#demo" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#demo" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#demo" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- The slideshow -->
  <div class="carousel-inner">

    <h3>Drawing People </h3>
<p>I spent most of my life telling myself "I'll never be able to draw people so why start now?"  But part way through 2017 I just said screw it and started messing around with drawing empty bodies in different positions.  They started out ugly but due to my meticulous nature I slowly began improving on proportions and realistic stances.  There's still a looooong waay to go but as time passes, my appretiation for drawing characters has grown, as they can show much more expression and life than anything else I've done before.  One day I'd love to be able to produce half decent 3D faces and hands that don't look like a sick cartoon. </p>

    <h3>Straight Lines and Cool Machines </h3>
<p>My ability to draw straight lines without a ruler as laughable.  Regardless, I've always had a love for how fictional machines and vehicles looked. Hey maybe one day I'll have the money to engineer ridiculous contraptions such as these.</p>

    <h3>Nature </h3>
<p>This is where it all started before I started expanding my repertoire, I've always enjoyed making simple sketches of landscapes when I was bored.</p>
