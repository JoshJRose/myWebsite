    <h3>Drawing People </h3>
<p>I spent most of my life telling myself "I'll never be able to draw people so why start now?"  But part way through 2017 I just said screw it and started messing around with drawing empty bodies in different positions.  They started out ugly but due to my meticulous nature I slowly began improving on proportions and realistic stances.  There's still a looooong waay to go but as time passes, my appretiation for drawing characters has grown, as they can show much more expression and life than anything else I've done before.  One day I'd love to be able to produce half decent 3D faces and hands that don't look like a sick cartoon. </p>
